INTRODUCTION                                      *learnviml-Introduction*

What is VimL? In simple terms, it's Vim's scripting language, but the full
answer is a little more complicated than that. It's actually more than one
language; it's a procedural expression language (with prototypal OOP
extensions) wrapped around a declarative command language (called Ex). It has
builtin regular expressions making text manipulation easier, a comprehensive
library of builtin functions for manipulating strings, floats, lists and
dictionaries as well as Vim editor objects like buffers, windows, tabs and the
myriad auxiliary entities surrounding them. It supports procedural,
functional(-ish) and object-oriented approaches to software development. It may
not be the prettiest language in the world, but it definietly gets the job
done.

I intend here to walk you through the most important parts of the Vim Reference
Manual and User Guide pertaining to VimL. If you would rather read the essence
from start to end on your own, then:

* The builtin reference manual for VimL is |usr_41.txt|
* The expression language is covered in |eval.txt|

If you would like a more colourful, friendly and gentler introduction to the
wonderful world of VimL coding then see:

* Damian Conway's Beginner's Guide to VimL:
  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-vim-script-1/index.html

SEARCHABLE SAMPLES                          *learnviml-Searchable-Samples*
                                            *:LVL* *LVL*

When one of the authors first learnt to program it was with the wonderful
Borland Turbo C compiler. One of the best things about Turbo C was that it
came with extensive documentation for the standard C libraries. Each function
had a complete standalone snippet showing its usage.

In an attempt to emulate that excellence, LearnVimL comes with a builtin
command, :LVL <term> which searches the bundled samples for the given term,
displaying a title-list of matches. These matches are shown in the
|location-list|, so presisng <enter> on a list item will open up the
associated snippet in an editable buffer of its own. From there you can
|:source| the code to see it run and play with it for better understanding.

SYNTAX                                                  *learnviml-Syntax*

Before Vim, there was vi and it didn't have VimL as we know it today; it only
had Ex. VimL extends Ex with a procedural expression language which provides
looping constructs, conditional expressions and a rich expression language
with versatile data structures like lists (dynamic arrays) and dictionaries
(associative arrays, aka hashes/maps).

Before we jump into all that goodness, though, we ought to look at bare Ex
commands and the way they are invoked from within Vim.

Read the following parts of |cmdline.txt|
3. Ex command-lines         |cmdline-lines|
4. Ex command-line ranges   |cmdline-ranges|
6. Ex special characters    |cmdline-special|

Throughout this tutorial we will follow up the reading sections with little
quizes to make sure you're staying awake and keeping up.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise Set 1: The Ex Language

1.0 What is the Ex language and what is it used for in Vim?

1.1 How does it relate to VimL?

2.0 How do you comment out an Ex line?

2.1 How do you feel about this? Can you imagine any conflicts
    this might cause?

2.2 Which commands can't take a trailing comment? Why?

3.0 The ';' is used in shell and C to separate commands. How do
    you separate commands in Ex?

3.1 How do you escape the Ex command separator?

3.2 Which commands cannot use this command separator? Why?

3.3 How do you overcome this limitation?

3.4 The developer wanted to replace all apples with bananas and
    all cherries with durians, but his approach was broken. Why?
    Fix it:  (two acceptable solutions)

  :%s/apple/banana/|s/cherry/durian/

3.5 External commands (using the shell) consume the standard Ex
    command separator. What is the solution to this problem?

4.0 What meanings do '%' and '#' have on the Ex command line? When?

4.1 Explain the difference between these two commands:

  .
  $
  %

5.2 What is the command for the range from the line after the next
    occurrence of '^Chapter' and 5 lines before a subsequent '^Example'?

6.0 How do you insert the name of the current buffer into a command-line
    command? There are two solutions.

6.1 Using the |expand()| function, |:echo| the full path name of the
    current buffer.

6.2 What is the difference between <cword> and <cWORD>?

6.3 How do you pull the current <cword> up into the command-line?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

While it is assumed that you know how to set and test options in Vim, there
are several enhanced ways to play with options that you should brush up on.

Read the following parts of |options.txt|
1. Setting options          |set-option|

In terms of writing VimL, there are around a dozen important options that
influence how your scripts run and how happy you will be writing them.

2. Read the following specific options:
* |'debug'|
* |'eventignore'|
* |'ignorecase'|
* |'magic'|
* |'maxfuncdepth'|
* |'runtimepath'|
* |'verbose'|

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise Set 2: VimL-specific Options

1.0 What is the difference between these two commands?

  :set ignorecase?
  :set ignorecase

1.1 Show two ways to display the current value of an option.
    (hint: one uses :set and the other uses :echo)

1.2 How do you switch off a boolean option?

1.3 How do you toggle a boolean option?

1.4 What does this command do?

  :set magic&vim

1.5 How do you append values to string options?

1.6 How do you prepend values to string options?

1.8 How do you include whitespace and backslashes in option values?

1.9 What are local options? How do they differ to global options?
    What is the command to set local options?

1.10 How do you set the global value for a local option without altering
     the local value?

1.11 What is the difference between:

  :set ft=lisp
  :setf lisp

1.12 What are the two commands which open the interactive options brwoser?

3.0 When Vim is executing VimL in certain deeply nested situations, errors
    are often blindly ignored leaving the developer perplexed as to the
    source of problems. Name one way the developer can force Vim to show
    errors.

4.0 What are some reasons you could think of for the |'eventignore'| option?

5.0 Apart from setting |'ignorecase'|, what is another way the VimL
    developer can ensure case-sensitive matches?

6.0 Should you ever change the value of the |'magic'| option?
    What should you do to a developer who does?

7.0 Why does VimL have the |'maxfuncdepth'| option? What is the default
    depth? When would you increase this value?

8.0 What effect would altering the |'runtimepath'| have in the ~/.vimrc
    file? What type of plugin would rely heavily on this feature?

9.0 What does   :set verbose=12   do? When would you need to do that?

9.1 How can you solve the problem of information overload with the
    verbose option?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

VimL has native support for inline regular expressions, similar to Perl. This
makes VimL especially useful for manipulating text, a very common task for Vim
scripts, naturally. Vim's flavour of regular expressions is not like Perl /
PCRE, but it is nearly as powerful. In some cases, Vim provides even more
expressiveness than Perl regexes. You can read about the differences in
|perl-patterns|.

Everything in |eval.txt| is new to Vim and constitutes the Expression Language
portion of VimL - the stuff that people expect when they think of a
programming language: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, data types,
etc. Finally we're getting a look at the real language behind VimL.

Read from |variables| through to |sticky-type-checking| in |eval.txt|

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise Set 4: Variables

1.0 How many types of variables does VimL support?

1.1 Read |type()|. What is a better way to say:

  if type(somevar) == 2

1.2 How does VimL represent hexadecimal and octal numbers?

1.3 This is broken, fix it:

  if "foo"
    echo "you should see this"
  endif
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Read |char2nr()| , |nr2char()|, |str2nr()| , |str2float()| , and |printf()|
for explicit ways to convert between Numbers and Strings in VimL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise Set 5: Explicit Number Type Conversions

1.0 What could you imagine using |char2nr()| and |nr2char()| for?

2.0 We can use   echo "0x100" + 0   to convert the string to a number. How
    would you convert hexadecimal 100 to decimal without this string trick?

3.0 How would you convert 100 decimal to hexadecimal?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Read |NL-used-for-Nul| and |CR-used-for-NL| in |pattern.txt|

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise Set 6: Vim's Dirty <NL>, <CR> and <Nul> Relationship

Read sections |41.1| - |41.2| in |usr_41.txt|

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise Set 7: Expressions

1.0 Vim's command-line mode is initiated with the ':' key. Is it legal to
    start script commands in a vim file with a ':'?

1.1 If you visually highlight and yank a bunch of VimL lines from a buffer,
    how can you subsequently execute them?
    Hint: This is very useful for adhoc debugging and testing of stuff you
    find in the manuals.

2.0 What's the difference between |:set| and |:let| ?

3.0 How do you stop a long-running loop in Vim?

4.0 VimL doesn't support the ++ operator like C/C++ does. What does VimL
    provide as a shortcut instead of:

  :let i = i + 1

5.0 What does prepending s: to a variable do in VimL, like:

  :let s:count = 0

6.0 Why doesn't this for-loop work? Fix it without just reordering the list
    elements.

  for x in [1, 2.0, "3"]
    echo x
  endfor

  Hint: the variable, x, can't change (between certain) types

7.0 Why is this code not what the developer intended? Fix it.

  if !exists(extension)
    let extension = '.vim'
  endif

8.0 What is the difference between 'single-quoted' and "double-quoted"
    strings? Which type should you use?

Most modern scripting languages (from Awk onwards, if memory serves) offer
arrays and associative arrays (also called hashes, maps or dictionaries)
because many programming needs are adequately met with just these two data
structures. VimL has these two data structures too, referring to them as Lists
and Dictionaries respectively: Lists are integer indexed arrays, and
Dictionaries are string indexed associative arrays.

Read section |41.8| in |usr_41.txt| , but for now, skip over the Object
Oriented part. This topic is covered later in |learnviml-OOP| .

more than 250 functions for working with strings, numbers, lists,
dictionaries, buffers, windows, tabs, the arg-list, system commands, file
operations, and many more of the Vim internals. The following exercises are
designed to expose you to many of the useful functions in this library. You
don't have to do all of these exercises now; you could instead use this

Vim has a rich event system which is programmed through the autocommand
interface. There are around eighty different events in various categories,
like Reading & Writing files; manipulating Buffers, Windows and Tabs; changing
Options; starting and closing Vim; Shell interaction; and tracking cursor
movement and Insert Mode switching.

One of Vim's killer features is Motions, the ability to manipulate entire
textual clusters as single objects, moving between them, moving them, yanking
and putting them, and visually selecting them for even more complicated
operations. Happily, the Vim developer is also granted the power to create
their own motions to provide these powerful editing benefits to their own
users.

The rite of passage for any Vim developer is to create their own Plugin. Vim
has hundreds of plugins providing incredibly diverse features and
functionality never dreamed of by the original authors, Bill & Bram. In this
section you will learn about the standard components of normal Vim plugins,
but you will also install a helper plugin called Area41 which provides
templates to save you the hassle of putting all the standard work into the
creation of new plugins. This will let you create compliant plugins quickly,
allowing you to focus on the important part - your code.

Exercise Set 43: Writing Normal Plugins
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every programming language you edit in Vim has a corresponding filetype plugin
in the background which silently reconfigures the various Vim indentation,
syntax, colouring and compilation options whenever you start editing a file of
that type. Here you're going to learn how to write a filetype plugin of your
own.

CHALLENGES                                          *learnviml-Challenges*

You now know most of the various pieces that constitute the VimL landscape.
Well, you've -seen- them anyway. To know them, you're going to have to -use-
them. What follows here is an increasingly involved set of challenges aimed at
giving you that practice. Do them all or do the ones that catch your fancy.
Design for yourself other challenges that require you to flex your newfound
VimL muscles.

	*Todo	these tasks have not been ordered by difficulty yet, and many more need to be added.

. Write an autocommand that removes trailing whitespace from all lines in the
  buffer when the user exits insert mode.

. VimL lacks a random number generator. Write one without shelling out to the
  OS.

. Write a syntax plugin for a filetype you use that is missing from Vim, or
  improve an existing filetype that has bugs, limitations or omissions.

. Write a plugin that receives commands from one window but performs them in
  another. Particular commands to support include: * and <c-]>

. Vim's native tab-page interface is a bit clunky. Write a plugin that makes
  tabs work the way you know they should.
